            You awaken. The tough ground feels cool on your skin, and you lift your head to peer upon the landscape. You are astonished, because as you look around, you realize that this is no place you have seen before, yet at the same time you know exactly where you are. Rising to your feet, you feel the blood rush to your head, and wonder how long you have been lying there. You can feel the heat of the yellow sun and the icy cold of the ground below you act simultaneously in changing your own body temperature. The craters before you lie still, quiet, and you stare upon the desolate landscape, knowing that something has gone very wrong.
